# artgallerydb
Project for information systems db class, using oracle 11g RDB as the backend, and connecting MS Access as a frontend UI for data modification, querying, and reporting. SQL does include some PL/SQL.
If you wish to try it out, you're on your own as I don't quite remember how I connected oracle to access. I'll update this if I remember.
Also, ERD is not 100% accurate/updated as it was mostly used to help for the initial design, but gives you enough reference.
